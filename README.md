A near 1:1 port of Five Nights at Freddy's 1 to the Nintendo 64.
Unfortunately, for the time being, it is unplayable in it's current state
due to needing to add the ability to supply your own copy of the game and
extract the assets, [similar to the SM64 Decomp Project.](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64)
